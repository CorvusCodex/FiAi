# FiAi (Under Development)
Simple Finance Forecasting Ai. This Ai Model uses historical price data to forecast future prices. The model is trained on data downloaded from Yahoo Finance using the yfinance library, and predictions are made using a linear regression Ai model from sklearn. The model supports all the symbols supported by Yahoo Finance. https://finance.yahoo.com/lookup/
The model is trying to forecast prices for next 24h, 7 days, 1 month and 1 year.

Forecasting Financial prices is extremely complex and should not be done solely based on historical prices. Factors such as market trends, global economic indicators, and company financials should also be considered. This script is a very basic example and should and will be expanded upon for more accurate forecasts. Always consult with a financial advisor before making investment decisions. It is important to use FiAi responsibly and not rely on its predictions.
